# Why?

.large[
-   **Arabic written tradition is vast and understudied**
  -   _c._ 40,000 titles (reported in the bibliography _Hadiyaŧ al-ʿārifīn_)
  -   _c._ 1,000,000 manuscripts in Iran alone ([scripts.nlai.ir](https://scripts.nlai.ir/))
  -   *we do not really know how many have been published*
  -   _c._ 6,400 titles (_c._ 1 billion tokens) have been digitized ([OpenITI](https://github.com/OpenITI/))
]

---

# Why?

.large[
-   **historical and biographical texts** (*chronicles* and *biographical collections*)<br><br>
  -   *low hundreds?*
  -   _c._ 300 texts digitized
  -   _c._ 100,000,000 words
  -   _c._ 500,000 biographical records
]

???

-   The tradition is particularly rich in chronicles and biographical collections;
-   These texts are often truly extensive. (Ibn Asakir ±9mln; Dhahabi - 3.3 mln; 2.9 mln; Mizzi - 2.6 mln)
-   They preserve massive amounts of information on historical processes that shaped and molded Islamic societies. 
-   They are crucial for our understanding of this chapter in the history of the humanity.
-   Their numbers run into low hundreds
-   For the project that I am proposing I have collected some 300 texts
-   - a corpus of 100 million words
-   - 485 thousand biographical records

---

# Why?

.large[

- **historical and biographical texts** (*chronicles* and *biographical collections*)<br><br>
  -   **_Potentially:_**:<br> we have information to produce a robust model of the development of the Islamic world
  -   **_So far, unfortunately:_**<br> “our blessing and our curse”<br>— as Wadād al-Qāḍī put it
]

???
-   **Unfortunately**: the very volume of this information so far has been both “our blessing and our curse”, as a leading Arabist put it
-   so far, it has been a real methodological “bottleneck” for our field.

---

# Methodological Solution

<img src="./images/meth_sol.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 800px;"/>


???
-   My project offers a methodological solution that will allow us to study these sources holistically, and in an effective and reproducible manner.
-   At the heart of the project is a machine-readable corpus of Arabic texts and series of advanced computational methods of text analysis and data modeling.
-   I will be happy to give more details on the methods during the QA later
-   Together they are the key to discovering, evaluating, and modeling all relevant textual evidence at an unprecedented scale.

## Approach to Textual Sources

- the main focus is on *Minimal Units of Information*, e.g., descriptions of events from chronicles, and biographical records from biographical collections:<br><br>
  -  *premise:* narratives are consciously constructed, while myriads of details scattered across vast texts simply cannot be subjected to the same level of agenda-driven editing;  in large quantities, such agenda-resistant data is likely to provide more reliable historical evidence<br><br>
- *MUI* will be aggregated into clusters of related historical information, which will be consequently studied<br><br>
- Each primary source will be broken into such units and they all will be re-aggregated into *MasterChronicle*, which will serve as a unified research ecosystem for the project and its collaborators

---
## Research Methods

.large[
- **first group:** text-mining methods for generating metadata layers that would allow grouping MUI into multiple clusters<br><br>
- **second group:** modeling and analysis of extracted information<br><br>
- **third group:** more traditional close-reading approaches to “important” clusters of information

# Scary Numbers

.large[

- since 2001 (less than 20 years) the number of publications doubled

- Even if we consider the most conservative growth rate, there may be twice as many publications about the Islamic world—1,2 billion!—by the year 2040.

- biographies of women in al-Ḏahabī’s *Taʾrīḫ al-islām*

???
Topic #20 in al-Dhahabi’s “History” is on biographies of women. The topic is identified through the following shared tokens, most of which include feminine words, verbs in feminine forms, female pronouns, and prepositional phrases with feminine pronominal suffixes: (1) “daughter”; (2) “mother”; (3) “from-her”, i.e., [transmitted religious knowledge] “from her”; (4) “Fatima”, a female name; (5) “[she]-died”; (6) “to-her”; (7) “and-she”; (8) “[she] transmitted”; (9) “and-[she]-was”; (10) “and-[she]-died”; (11) “and-Fatima”, a female name; ... (14) “from-her” [the knowledge was transmitted]; (15) “sister”; (16) “pious” — feminine form; (17) “Zaynab”, a female name; (18) “and-[she]-listened”, i.e., she studied [with someone]; … and so on.
