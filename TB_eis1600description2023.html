# Why?

.large[
-   **Arabic written tradition is vast and understudied**
  -   _c._ 40,000 titles (reported in the bibliography _Hadiyaŧ al-ʿārifīn_)
  -   _c._ 1,000,000 manuscripts in Iran alone ([scripts.nlai.ir](https://scripts.nlai.ir/))
  -   *we do not really know how many have been published*
  -   _c._ 6,400 titles (_c._ 1 billion tokens) have been digitized ([OpenITI](https://github.com/OpenITI/))
]

---

# Why?

.large[
-   **historical and biographical texts** (*chronicles* and *biographical collections*)<br><br>
  -   *low hundreds?*
  -   _c._ 300 texts digitized
  -   _c._ 100,000,000 words
  -   _c._ 500,000 biographical records
]

???

-   The tradition is particularly rich in chronicles and biographical collections;
-   These texts are often truly extensive. (Ibn Asakir ±9mln; Dhahabi - 3.3 mln; 2.9 mln; Mizzi - 2.6 mln)
-   They preserve massive amounts of information on historical processes that shaped and molded Islamic societies. 
-   They are crucial for our understanding of this chapter in the history of the humanity.
-   Their numbers run into low hundreds
-   For the project that I am proposing I have collected some 300 texts
-   - a corpus of 100 million words
-   - 485 thousand biographical records

---

# Why?

.large[

- **historical and biographical texts** (*chronicles* and *biographical collections*)<br><br>
  -   **_Potentially:_**:<br> we have information to produce a robust model of the development of the Islamic world
  -   **_So far, unfortunately:_**<br> “our blessing and our curse”<br>— as Wadād al-Qāḍī put it
]

???
-   **Unfortunately**: the very volume of this information so far has been both “our blessing and our curse”, as a leading Arabist put it
-   so far, it has been a real methodological “bottleneck” for our field.

# Methodological Solution

<img src="./images/meth_sol.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 800px;"/>


???
-   My project offers a methodological solution that will allow us to study these sources holistically, and in an effective and reproducible manner.
-   At the heart of the project is a machine-readable corpus of Arabic texts and series of advanced computational methods of text analysis and data modeling.
-   I will be happy to give more details on the methods during the QA later
-   Together they are the key to discovering, evaluating, and modeling all relevant textual evidence at an unprecedented scale.

The following graph shows how these 200+ texts with biographical information are distributed chronologically. Note: dates are in Islamic hijrī calendar; surrounded with red are texts written in the 11th century; to the right --- those that are written after

## Chronology (*exploratory*)

???
The following graph shows how some 500,000 biographical records are distributed chronologically. Note: dates are in Islamic hijrī calendar; surrounded with red are biographies written in the 11th century (±55,000 biographies); to the right --- those that are written after (quite a significant part of those a biographies of individuals from the 11th century)**

## Approach to Textual Sources

- the main focus is on *Minimal Units of Information*, e.g., descriptions of events from chronicles, and biographical records from biographical collections:<br><br>
  -  *premise:* narratives are consciously constructed, while myriads of details scattered across vast texts simply cannot be subjected to the same level of agenda-driven editing;  in large quantities, such agenda-resistant data is likely to provide more reliable historical evidence<br><br>
- *MUI* will be aggregated into clusters of related historical information, which will be consequently studied<br><br>
- Each primary source will be broken into such units and they all will be re-aggregated into *MasterChronicle*, which will serve as a unified research ecosystem for the project and its collaborators

---
## Research Methods

.large[
- **first group:** text-mining methods for generating metadata layers that would allow grouping MUI into multiple clusters<br><br>
- **second group:** modeling and analysis of extracted information<br><br>
- **third group:** more traditional close-reading approaches to “important” clusters of information
